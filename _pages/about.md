Hello! I’m Jess, a Human-Computer Interaction Research Scientist. I work at <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/">Niantic, Inc.</a>, where I research & develop <a href="https://research.nianticlabs.com/publications/">augmented reality related applications</a> to help people explore the world around them.

Before Niantic, I obtained my PhD in computer science at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> while working in Dr. Hal Abelson’s <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor lab</a>. There, I developed <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/147337">conversational agent technology</a> to empower and teach young learners about AI.

Prior to MIT, I was a mechanical engineering student at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>, where I researched <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2018.02.012">autonomous vehicles</a> and driver assistance systems in Dr. Homayoun Najjaran's <a href="https://acis.ok.ubc.ca/">ACIS lab</a>.
