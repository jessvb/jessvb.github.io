Hello! I’m Jess, a Human-Computer Interaction Research Scientist. I work at <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/">Niantic, Inc.</a>, where I research & develop augmented reality related applications to help people explore the world around them.

Before Niantic, I obtained my PhD in computer science at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> while working in Dr. Hal Abelson’s <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor lab</a>. There, I developed conversational agent technology to empower and teach young learners about AI.

Prior to MIT, I was a mechanical engineering student at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>, where I researched autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems in Dr. Homayoun Najjaran's <a href="https://acis.ok.ubc.ca/">ACIS lab</a>.
